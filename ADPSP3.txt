SPRING BOOT NOTES
*****************

Shows all info about errors 

server.error.include-binding-errors=always
server.error.include-exception=true
server.error.include-message=always
server.error.include-stacktrace=always



In runtimeexception is dosenÂ´t necesessary to take a try and catch, but in exception it`s necessary to take it.


Another mechanisim @ExecpetionHandler 


Spring 5 -> ResponseEstatusException takes the exception and trows a response, two exception can trows the same response
because the response has his own responsability.


We will use -> @(Rest)ControllerAdvice

If the service trows an error it throws a personal exception to a class who are a group of common modals of erros and it 
will return the response to the client.

We will use an interface with abstracts methot and another class will implement it and then the class will take 
body of the interface

Change spring boot 2-3
imports*
javaX -> jakarta



Pring 6 -> class Problem Detail adds all personal properties we want
